The standard lot in professional interbank Forex trading is generally $5 million. If a trader wants to do less, he specifies “small” or the amount when asking for a bid/offer, and if he wants to do more, he will say “size.”")

This is overall true. You do not see micro lots in oil, corn, or equities, although technically, you could buy 10 shares of a stock priced at $13.50 with no leverage. Bigger equity players can get a 50% margin from the brokerage houses, but if all you have to trade with is a capital stake of $135, the broker is not offering you leverage.")
