When you are placing a market order, you don’t care about minor slippage like this. Slippage goes both ways — it can also be in your favor — but negative slippage is what you will see 90% of the time, and it can become quite expensive. Why is slippage usually negative? Two reasons — the market is already moving in the direction you want it to go, and a preponderance of traders is also either buying or selling at the same time. The other reason is that the broker’s computer is programmed to take an extra pip or fraction of a pip when activity is high.")

The limit order eliminates slippage because you specify the exact rate you want when you place the order. Or rather, it should. But if you are entering a large order, you could be only partially filled at your desired level, and in order to get the full size you wanted, you would have to step in and buy or sell at the market manually to get the amount you want. By that time, of course, the rate you want is long gone. Now, you have to calculate the average entry from your original limit order plus the top-up order, and that can get messy.")

You do not get filled — and yet you saw your limit order price on the screen. Before screaming that you have been cheated, consider that brokers fill orders on a first-come, first-served basis. If other traders had the same idea and the same limit order but placed their orders before you did, they got filled, and you didn’t. This is sometimes called the “queue problem”, and broker customer support staff spend a lot of time explaining it to newcomers.")

The end-of-session dip is temporary, but let’s say it’s essential to your trading plan — because you can divine the high of the next trading session using technical indicators. In other words, you can see where the currency “should” go once the up move resumes in the next trading session, but the current price doesn’t offer a sufficient number profit points. Therefore, you want to capture a slightly lower price for your entry. As long as you are not greedy and are willing to cancel the limit order and go with a market order if you don’t get filled, this is a perfectly acceptable use of the limit order.")

But, as noted, you might not get filled, and so you may need to do a certain amount of screen-watching, anyway.")

If the price does indeed go to 1.6500, the stop order becomes a market order, and remember the key characteristic of market orders — they are subject to slippage.

Technically, a stop order can be used to stop a loss or to name a profit target, and ideally, you will place both orders every single time you place a trade. This cannot be emphasized enough. If you do not use a stop-loss order, it’s not a question of whether you will go broke, but rather when. This is because your electricity may go out, your PC may fail, or your courage may desert you in favor of wishful thinking as you see your trade go against you but cannot pull the trigger to exit. When your stop has been placed already, you are saved from these outcomes. This is such an important point that many brokers now shove a little entry box at you labeled “stop-loss order.” They are trying to get you to make the stop-loss order an automatic order, which protects them against you as well as protecting you against yourself.")

An OCO order always comes in pairs and can be either a stop or a limit order. If you are using the stop version, you would typically specify that if a lower level is met, you are a seller at that level, and the accompanying buy-stop part of the order is automatically canceled upon the sell order getting filled. The limit order version usually has you going short at the higher price and long at the lower price, with the other order automatically canceled if one gets filled. You can achieve the same outcome by placing two separate orders yourself as long as you remember to cancel the other yourself, too.")

In the absence of OCO, let’s say you are long GBP/USD. Your stop is hit while you are sleeping — but then the currency reverses direction, and now your upside target is hit, too. Now, instead of being square, as you intended, you are short! Some prominent platforms do not offer OCO, and some sophisticated platforms offer it but are overly complicated.")

You need to confirm from your broker which expiration version they are using. Most brokers will use “good until canceled,” but you should verify the policy. Let’s say you place a stop at 1.6000 under a purchase of GBP/USD at 1.6100 during the Asian session. A few days go by. The stop gets hit two days later in the European session, but the broker fails to execute on your behalf because your stop expired under that broker’s operating procedures at the end of the session during which you placed it.")
