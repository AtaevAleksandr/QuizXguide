In fact, trading dollar/yen is more complicated than trading Sony shares, if only because you have two economies to track, not to mention risk factors that do not affect equities, like territorial disputes, oil prices, and other things. Studying the fundamentals of Sony and its markets is no mean task in its own right, but FX fundamentals are broader and deeper. Do not confuse complexity with sophistication.")

How much liquidity do you need, anyway? If you were trading equities, you might want to scan the universe for names that traded a minimum of 100,000 shares per day.

We have central clearing in the primary interbank FX market but no central clearing for retail spot Forex.  Most governments do not even try to regulate the retail market. Retail brokers have many tricks to cheat the customer. Probably the most common one is that they do not even place your trade. They know you have a low capital amount, and your stop is (say) 10 points. They are willing to bet that your stop will get hit, and they will not have to cover the trade from their side. If your target is hit instead, they may say your stop got hit anyway, even though you don’t find that price anywhere on a database of prices for the day. This is one of the benefits of futures trading, by the way, compared to spot. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange posts “time and sales” for every blessed trade done, and you can prove whether a stop or target was hit. Such proof stands up in a court of law, too.")

If you can do that every day with no losses, on 240 trading days per year, you would make $14,400/100,000 = 14.4%.

For the moment, consider that to make the same $3,600 as the day trader who trades three times per day, you would have to get (say) 36 points but only ten times over the course of the year, net of losses.

You are, in essence, borrowing most of the face amount of the $100,000. In some places, you can borrow virtually all of it, but in the USA, leverage is limited to 50 times since October 2010. That means if you want to trade one lot worth $100,000, you need to put down $2,000 as your initial margin ($100,000 divided by 50).  If your first trade goes against you and you take a loss, you have to top it up with more money. In practice, your first trade should be backed by the $2,000 required under the regulations, plus the amount you could lose if your stop is hit (plus maybe a little extra), or at least $2,500.")

The first reason is that the broker expects you to fail. He expects that more than half your trades will be stopped, and they will be stopped right away at the beginning of your trading career. The broker may not have placed your trade onward with a counterparty in the first place, so if your loss was (say) $250, he gets to keep all of it. Some brokers have been accused of “hunting stops” in their own accounts specifically to hit the stops of small traders. If you believe that you have been stopped out incorrectly, you can contact the broker to try to resolve the issue or, if that fails, contact the government regulator - but only if the broker is regulated. That is why it is generally a good idea to trade only with regulated brokers.")

On the three trades per day described above, that is $4,320, or 4.43% on $97,500. Since the broker can borrow the $97,500 at a rate less than 4.43%, he gets to keep the difference. But in practice, he usually doesn’t need to borrow the $97,000 at all in the first place — the broker is being extended credit-free or very cheaply by the banks and brokers where he is passing on your trades. In essence, they give the broker free or cheap credit to drive volume to their trading desks. Bottom line, the broker is motivated to get and to keep your trading business, and the more day-trading you do, the better he likes it because of that $3 per side profit he is making.")
