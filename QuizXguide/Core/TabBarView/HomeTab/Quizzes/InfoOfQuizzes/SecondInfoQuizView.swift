The obvious answer is that euro traders were in the process of changing their minds about the value of either the euro or the value of the dollar. Actually, since no one knows or can even guess what the true value might be, the euro trader is guessing what others will think in the future about the appropriate price of the euro or the dollar. If the euro trader is a seller today at 1.12758, it is because he interprets some piece of data or news unfavorable to the euro that will make others unwilling to pay as much for it as today’s price. The future may be two minutes, two days, or two weeks, but the skill of the trader lies in assigning a probability to the interpretation of the data or news by the rest of the market.")

While the Forex trader will not actually use euros in the sense of spending them on goods and services, he anticipates that others will want to use the euro’s purchasing power to buy stuff, not only socks and haircuts but also securities denominated in euros. Therefore, Forex traders follow the macroeconomics and news stories pertaining to the relative purchasing power of the euro vs. the dollar, including inflation (or deflation), wage increases, the robustness of the economy, and so on. At any one time, the market as a whole has a consensus view of which economies are growing and how fast and which economies have immediate economic problems that the government and, specifically, the central bank should be addressing. As a rule, traders’ economic understanding is oversimplified and even crude and usually boiled down to a catchy one or two-word descriptor. Still, it does not pay to be snobbish about the relative lack of sophistication of these views—they move markets.")

The single most important piece of news is a change in interest rates or other stimulus/contraction by a central bank. A good example is the interest rate decision by the Federal Reserve (Fed) on July 27, 2023. To combat the rapidly rising inflation, the Fed made a decision to increase interest rates and sent a signal that it is likely to raise the rates at least one more time by the end of the year. The dollar's purchasing power increased due to the decision, which can be seen on the chart as the sharp drop in the euro's strength versus the dollar's. It is interesting to note that the EUR/USD was falling faster before the interest rate announcement than after it. Such behavior is not uncommon when the result is expected and is priced in, and, indeed, markets were counting on the Fed's rate hike. The currency pair reversed its movement the next day as the European Central Bank (ECB) also hiked its interest rates. And again, the currency pair was moving faster before the announcement than after it. The probable reason is the same - the ECB's decision matched traders' expectations.")
