During the early 2000s, brokers started making quotes using the fractional pip, or a fifth digit past the decimal point, like 1.38015. A fractional pip (also called a pipette) is a tenth of a pip. Brokers advertised fractional pips as allowing the trader to get a tighter bid-ask spread and to take advantage of smaller price moves, but fractional pips also lured traders with only tiny amounts of trading capital into the market and facilitated high-speed algo traders. Do enough profitable trades, making only one fractional pip, and soon you are talking about some real money. Another high-speed user of the fractional pip is the spread bettor.")

As noted above, when the dollar is the second name in a pair, you can usually assume the pip size is $0.10 per micro-lot, $1 per mini-lot, and $10 per standard lot. When the currency pair has the dollar as the first-named currency of the pair, the amounts being bought and sold refer to the other currency, and you have to translate those into dollars at the ending amount.
