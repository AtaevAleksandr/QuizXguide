A good way to figure out what those times are in local time is to Google “What time is it in London and Frankfurt?” You can also keep a set of clocks set to different time zones, as most professional trading rooms do.")

The best time to trade the yen (USD/JPY or EUR/JPY) is when Tokyo is open, and the very best time to trade the EUR/USD is before New York opens and then again after New York has opened. The EUR/USD does trade during the Asian session, but European news releases come out around an hour to two before the London open, meaning London traders tend to get to work early to catch them.

The journalists crowd the hallways of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan to catch officials on their way in and out, hoping for a tidbit to write about.
