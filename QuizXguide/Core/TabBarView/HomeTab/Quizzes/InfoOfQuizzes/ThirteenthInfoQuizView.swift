In a back-test, the software will take that number as the actual entry. Nevertheless, in real trading, you may get filled at 1.4004. Those four points may seem minor on any single trade, but now consider that your stop may get hit at another four points worse than your order. Now you have “lost” eight points. A key issue in turbulent markets can be the price jumping over your stop, and you get filled at 30 points under your stop. Now, you have lost 34 points.")

Do not blame the system vendor — it is the nature of the beast and an inevitable part of the process. When you see a hypothetical track record of a trading system from a vendor, you need to check how much slippage would have reduced total profitability. At a guess, slippage cuts 10-20% from the reported P&L. The system may still be a valuable one and worth your consideration — just be realistic about your expectations. If the system has delivered 40% returns, you should expect the real percentage gain you will get would always be less than 40%.")

This is because market conditions change faster than system adaptability. A trading system that relies on trendedness will do badly in a range-trading market, and a system that does well in range-trading conditions will not do as well as a trending system in a trending market. One of the biggest challenges in technical system-building, if not the biggest, is differentiating between trending and range trading. Every software-based trading system is based on one or the other condition, and those that try to do both almost always have a strong component of human judgment injected, called “discretion.”")
