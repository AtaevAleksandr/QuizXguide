Also used is the word “currency,” as in “I trade currencies” or “something happened in the currency market.”")

Foreign exchange is the only market in which the word rate is used in place of the word price. The reason for this usage is probably due to the word “rate” being used since the Middle Ages to refer to a tariff or tax levy since converting one currency to another entails applying a ratio or a proportion to one currency relative to the other. A common Latin phrase is “pro rata” from “pro rata parte,” meaning “in proportion.” The word “rate” in English comes from the Latin “rata.”")

The answer lies in the historical convention of quoting the price of other currencies in terms of what they cost in pounds. The pound sterling was the benchmark currency for centuries until just after World War II, meaning the central currency against which all other currencies were judged and priced.")

But because the dollar is currently the benchmark currency against which almost all others are priced, the dollar comes first in the name of many currency pairs, although not all.

In other words, the first currency is the base, and you are applying a ratio to derive the price of the second currency. When the European Monetary Union decided to quote the euro in the format “Euro/USD” and “Euro/JPY,” etc., it was a deliberate choice to make the euro the more important of the two currencies in every pair.")

Suppose the number goes up in the pound, for example, from 1.6000 to 1.6500. In that case, it means the pound is getting stronger, and by definition, the dollar is getting weaker because, in this pair, the full quote should read GBP/USD. It is accurate to express the quote as $1.6000 to $1.6500, meaning the pound used to cost $1.6000, but now it costs $1.6500. Journalists usually apply the convention of putting the dollar sign in front of the price quote, although brokers and analysts tend not to insert the currency symbol.")

You could say the EUR/USD moved from 1.3200 to 1.3900, meaning it got more expensive in dollar terms. If you are new to Forex, you can place an imaginary currency symbol in front of the first-named currency to get your bearings. Therefore, the price quote now looks like $1.3200 to $1.3900.")

The US dollar accounts for about 60% of global government money reserves, 40% of world trade in goods, and about 90% of global foreign exchange trade, so placing the dollar as a component in all the major exchange rates is not without justification. In fact, there are more dollars in banknotes and bank deposit accounts outside the US than inside the US, so it may be accurate to say the dollar is the most-used currency in some places, even though it is not the home currency. However, when someone says “the euro,“ he is always talking about EUR/USD and never talking about EUR/GBP, in which case the second currency must be named.")
