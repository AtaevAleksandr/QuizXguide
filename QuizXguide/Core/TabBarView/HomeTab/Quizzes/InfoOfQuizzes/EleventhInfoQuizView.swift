Let’s say your position goes against you but not enough to trigger your stop-loss. A good broker will notify you that you have X amount of time to top up your account with additional funds, usually before the end of the next business day and sometimes before noon. The broker’s telephone call to you is named a “margin call” and always means you have misjudged something. More on that later.")

That is the rule in the USA, instituted in 2010, with a maximum leverage of 20 times (1:20) in lesser-traded currencies, such as the USD/MXN (US dollar vs. Mexican peso), for example. Outside the USA, a broker may offer you leverage of 1:400, 1:500, and even more. 1:500 leverage, for example, means that for a starting capital amount of $500, you could buy as much as $250,000 worth of currencies.")

An initial margin is a form of collateral that the lender (the broker) takes from you as a “good faith” gesture. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange uses the somewhat old-fashioned language of “performance bond” to describe initial margin. The maintenance margin is the additional funding you have to make to keep the correct ratio between owned and borrowed money. The maintenance margin is determined by a procedure that starts with “marking the position to market” or MTM.")

Your broker calls you up and says that if you do not add funds to the account to maintain the minimum margin requirement, he will close out the position at the loss of $400, which you will still owe.")

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange discloses its calculations for initial and maintenance margin on its website. The CME procedure is named SPAN, which stands for Standard Portfolio Analysis of Risk, and was developed in 1988. It is available to the public (since 1999) for $10, but you had better be skillful with spreadsheets if you want to use it yourself. The basic principle is that the exchange applies a volatility factor to each currency to determine the likelihood that an additional margin will be needed.")

In retail spot Forex, brokers do not differentiate among the currencies in setting initial margins, but they borrowed the CME’s practices with respect to maintenance margin. How do retail spot brokers calculate initial and maintenance margins? Typically, they require a minimum margin plus a “cushion” because management of margin calls is administratively labor-intensive. For example, on a $1,000 lot, the initial margin could be the usual 2% for 1:50 leverage or $20, but the required additional cushion could be $20 for a low-volatility currency (CAD), $32 for a medium-volatility currency (EUR) or $38 for a high-volatility currency (UK pound). Many brokers also offer a margin tracker on their platforms so that you can get an alert when you are at risk of a margin call.")

This is why most brokers advise against using maximum leverage — a random blip in the price can wipe you out.")

Now, you have to make a gain of 25% to get back to your starting point. And you need to accomplish that 25% gain using a lesser starting capital amount, or $8,000. Now, using 1:50 leverage gets you control of $400,000 in face amount instead of the $500,000 you used to have. Let’s say you take another 20% loss, or $1,600.
